# CreatorHub

CreatorHub aims to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 platforms like YouTube and the decentralized Web3 ecosystem. By giving creators the ability to own and control their content, we empower them to expand their personal brands, unlock new revenue streams, and deepen audience engagement.

## Problem Statement

Based on data from June 2024 (Google Transparency Report), over 8 million videos have been removed from YouTube, which represents a significant loss of opportunity and revenue for creators. With CreatorHub, we provide a solution—creators can secure their content on-chain, ensuring they never lose opportunities due to platform restrictions. By leveraging Web3, we offer creators the tools to build independent, sustainable careers while retaining full control of their content and monetization options.

## Challenges

CreatorHub focuses on solving the challenge of content ownership and monetization for YouTube creators. Currently, many creators rely on ad revenue and platform-driven algorithms, which limit their earning potential and make them vulnerable to sudden changes in platform policies. Traditional platforms don't offer true ownership or flexibility in how creators can monetize their content.

In the Web3 space, we see a huge opportunity for creators to claim ownership of their content through NFTs and create new forms of interaction and income. However, there's a significant knowledge gap when it comes to how YouTube creators can transition to Web3 without being overwhelmed by its technical complexities. CreatorHub is designed to make this transition simple, helping creators mint their channels and videos as NFTs, and implement new monetization strategies like royalties and subscriptions.

## Solution

CreatorHub addresses these challenges by providing a platform where YouTube creators can easily mint their channels as NFTs, securing ownership and gaining control over their content in Web3. For the next update, CreatorHub aims to help creators transition from Web2 to Web3 seamlessly by introducing features like video minting, subscription programs via Super Pass, and royalty-sharing mechanisms.

With Super Pass, NFT holders can access exclusive content, allowing creators to deepen connections with their top fans. The royalty-sharing system will enable daily or monthly payouts to NFT holders, encouraging more active participation from fans while offering creators new income opportunities. Our goal is to make these features easy to use, so creators can stay focused on their content while enjoying the benefits of Web3’s decentralized model.

## Subscriber Tiers

CreatorHub will implement subscriber tiers based on the YouTube Play Button system. These tiers will allow creators to unlock unique NFT images that correspond to their subscriber count:

- **Basic NFT (less than 10,000 subscribers)**: Creators will receive a basic NFT, providing them a foundational presence in the CreatorHub ecosystem.
- **Silver Play Button (100,000 subscribers)**: Creators will receive an NFT with a special silver design, representing their achievement.
- **Gold Play Button (1,000,000 subscribers)**: This tier will unlock a distinct gold NFT, celebrating their milestone.
- **Diamond Play Button (10,000,000 subscribers)**: For top-tier creators, a unique diamond NFT will be available, signifying their exceptional success.

These tiered NFTs will serve as both a badge of honor and a way to visually differentiate creators based on their subscriber count, enhancing their branding within the Web3 ecosystem.

## Challenges Encountered

One of the major challenges we faced was the limited documentation available for ZKFetch, which led to a trial-and-error process during deployment, especially when integrating with the YouTube API. This made the development process more complex and time-consuming.

Additionally, creating a smooth onboarding experience for YouTube creators unfamiliar with Web3 was no easy task. Many creators find the technical aspects of blockchain and NFTs overwhelming. To address this, we integrated BASE Smart Wallet technology, which allows users to create or register a new wallet simply through their email. This seamless technology eliminates the complexity often associated with setting up a crypto wallet, making it easier for creators to transition into Web3.

Another significant challenge was designing a secure and transparent royalty-sharing system. Our goal was to ensure that NFT holders could receive daily or monthly payouts in a fair and reliable way.
