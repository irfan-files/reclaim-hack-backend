# zkFetch.js
_fetch, but with a zkproof_

This library lets you fetch any remote resource over an https endpoint. Along with the response, you also get a proof of correct execution of the fetch that can be verified by a third party. 

For example, if you do a fetch with a private api key that the third party doesn't have access to, how do you prove to them that you executed the fetch correctly using the api key, and not sharing with them an arbitrary or tampered response? zkfetch.

zkFetch is based on [Reclaim Protocol](https://reclaimprotocol.org)

**Note : We recommend using zkproof only for data that is unlikely to change within 5s, i.e. during the process of proof generation**

## Pre-requisites

An application ID and secret from Reclaim Protocol. You can get one from the  [Reclaim Developer Protocol](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/)

## Usage

```
$ npm install @reclaimprotocol/zk-fetch
```

Import 
```
  const { ReclaimClient } = require("@reclaimprotocol/zk-fetch");
```

### Initialize Reclaim Client

```javascript
const client = new Reclaim('APPLICATION_ID', 'APPLICATION_SECRET');
```

### For public endpoints
If the endpoint you want to _fetch_ and generate a proof of the response. This endpoint is public, and doesn't need any private data like auth headers/api keys.

This is useful when
- Verifier needs to verify without re-doing the api call
- The API doesn't need any private headers or auth
- The proof or response needs to be generated for a particular endpoint now, and verified later

```
  const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
        accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
  }
  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions
  )
```

Note : all the data in the publicOptions will be visible to them who you share the proof with (aka, verifier).

### For private endpoint
If you want to _fetch_ and generate a proof of the response, but the fetch involves some private data like auth headers or api keys 

This is useful when 
- Using API keys
- Using Auth headers

```
  const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
      accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
  }

  const privateOptions = {
    headers {
        apiKey: "123...456",
        someOtherHeader: "someOtherValue",
    }
  }

  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions,
    privateOptions
  )

```

All the data in the privateOptions will stay hidden to the verifier.

### For commiting proofs
This is used when the proof needs guarantees on who generated it. This is particularly useful when you want to reward thirdparty entities for generating proofs of fetch responses.

```  

  //beta

  const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
      accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
  }

  const privateOptions = {
    headers {
        apiKey: "123...456",
        someOtherHeader: "someOtherValue",
    }
  }

  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions,
    privateOptions,
  )
```

### Using Response Matches and Redactions

You can also use responseMatches and responseRedactions to match and redact the response. This is useful when you want to verify the response against a particular value or redact some part of the response.

```
 const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
      accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
  }

  const privateOptions = {
    responseMatches: [
      {
        type: 'contains' | 'regex', // type of match 
        value: '<HTTP RESPONSE TEXT>' | '<REGEX>', // value to match or regex to match 
      }
    ],
    responseRedactions: [
      {
        jsonPath: '$.data', // JSON path to redact 
        xPath: '/data', // Xpath to redact  
        regex: '<REGEX>', // Regex to redact
      }
    ]
  }

  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions,
    privateOptions
  )
```

Note: The responseMatches and responseRedactions are optional and can be used as per the requirement.


## Using the response

The response looks like the follows
```
{
  claimData: {
    provider: 'http',
    parameters: '{"body":"","method":"GET","responseMatches":[{"type":"regex","value":"ethereum\\":{\\"usd\\":(?<price>.*?)}}"}],"responseRedactions":[],"url":"https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=usd"}',
    owner: '0x96faf173bb7171a530b3e44f35f32d1307bda4fa',
    timestampS: 1725377559,
    context: '{"extractedParameters":{"price":"2446.75"},"providerHash":"0xe5a9592ed030d011f1755f392c07aea1f3cb0492ad8910254b25f80ad556e3bb"}',
    identifier: '0x8518b246857a47658edc8314319305c1fb5eb666ec3ee36ae07e1564c73ff288',
    epoch: 1
  },
  identifier: '0x8518b246857a47658edc8314319305c1fb5eb666ec3ee36ae07e1564c73ff288',
  signatures: [
    '0x02d14b5f3377875ecab84125e53c2387b7b1a50b4762840b33dd24117326b88670818e24668aa65c5e80f8d71c192ba5803a9ca1415d72a81f3efcf1341379d41c'
  ],
  extractedParameterValues: { price: '2446.75' },
  witnesses: [
    {
      id: '0x307832343438393735373233363865616466363562666263356165633938643865353434336139303732',
      url: 'wss://witness.reclaimprotocol.org/ws'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Verify the proofs and transform proof for onchain

#### Verify the proofs

Install @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk

```bash 
$ npm install @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

Import the Reclaim class from the js-sdk

```javascript
const { Reclaim } = require('@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk');
```

Use Reclaim.verifySignedProof(proof)

You must send the proofObject and not the verifiedResponse to the verifier for them to be able to verify.

```javascript
const isProofVerified = await Reclaim.verifySignedProof(proof);
```

it verifies the authenticity and completeness of a given proof. It checks if the proof contains signatures, recalculates the proof identifier, and verifies it against the provided signatures. If the verification fails, it will log the error and return false.

More information about the verifySignedProof method can be found [here](https://docs.reclaimprotocol.org/sdk-methods#verifysignedproofproof--promiseboolean)

#### Transform proof for onchain

Transforms proof data into a format suitable for on-chain transactions, you need to use it before sending the proof to the blockchain.

Use Reclaim.transformForOnchain(proof) from the js-sdk to transform the proof for onchain.

```javascript
const onchainProof = Reclaim.transformForOnchain(proof);
```



### Add Retries and Retry Interval

You can add retries and timeout to the fetch request. The default value for retries is 1 and timeout is 1000ms.

```
  const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
      accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
  }

  const privateOptions = {
    headers {
        apiKey: "123...456",
        someOtherHeader: "someOtherValue",
    }
  }

  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions,
    privateOptions,
    5, // retries
    10000 // retryInterval
  )
```

### Add GeoLocation

You can add geolocation information to your fetch request. The default value for geoLocation is null.

Note: The geoLocation should be a two-letter ISO country code, for example, 'US' for the United States.

```
  const publicOptions = {
    method: 'GET', // or POST
    headers : {
      accept: 'application/json, text/plain, */*' 
    }
    // geoLocation should be a two-letter ISO country code, e.g., 'US' for the United States
    geoLocation: 'US'
  }

  const proof = await client.zkFetch(
    'https://your.url.org',
    publicOptions,
  )

```
